Application Description:
Includes simple functionalities such as the use of shopping carts and the addition of products through APIs. The user will be able to browse products and also be able to check any descriptions or images that are added to the post. Users will also be able to view similar listings once a product is purchased or is in their cart. This would be similar to an explore page for products the user may be interested in. Users will also be able to make safe payments through a payment API such as PayPal or afterpay. Once a purchase is made, it will be sent to a table that the user will be able to view post-purchase. Users will be able to add and remove products from their shopping carts. This website will closely resemble Amazon. Users will be able to add product reviews, based on stars as well as an optional description. This feature will only be allowed if the user purchases this item. Users will be able to create an account as well.
